# Web-Scrapping-Using-Python

🎯 Objectives
Automate Hotel Data Collection – Extract key details from Booking.com efficiently.
Flexible Scraping – Allow users to input a URL and filename for custom searches.
Data Storage – Save extracted hotel details in a structured CSV format.
Error Handling & Performance – Implement sleep timers and request headers for smooth scraping.
User-Friendly Execution – Provide a seamless command-line experience for users.


🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 3.8
BeautifulSoup4 – For parsing HTML and extracting hotel details.
Requests – For sending HTTP requests to Booking.com.
CSV – To store extracted data in a structured format.
LXML – For fast and efficient HTML parsing.


📂 Features & Workflow
Users provide a Booking.com search URL and a file name.
The scraper fetches the page and extracts:
Hotel Name 🏨
Price 💰
Location 📍
Rating ⭐
Review Count 📝
Booking Link 🔗
The extracted data is saved into a CSV file in the local directory.
The program implements random sleep intervals to mimic human behavior and avoid blocking.


🚀 How to Run the Script
Install required dependencies:
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
Run the script:
python script.py
Enter the Booking.com URL and file name when prompted.
The data will be scraped and saved as a CSV file.
